# Complicated Hello World.
A collection of programs that I found to be very worthy to be selected "Most Complicated way to print Hello World"

The end goal is for the program to print some form of `Hello World` either without `!`, different cases, and/or with/without the `,`

Contribution is always appreciated as there is never truly a real complicated way to prevent `Hello World!`!

**Categories**
Most popular languages are in their own folders, and have different forms and a number assigned. However, this does not mean `Form1` is better than `Form2`, etc.. 

On the other hand, for [esoteric languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), they will be in a separate folder, and divided by language name as eso-langs are already not really for humans. This folder will also include machine-languages (Assembly, etc.)

## Notice

1. Much of these code are not mine and so they will be credited to the original poster (if avaliable).
2. The file names will not correlate with in file items and must be readjusted manually if you want to see it in action yourself
